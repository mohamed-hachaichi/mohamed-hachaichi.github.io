## Brief introduction 

Mohamed Hachiachi holds a Ph.D in *"circular urban metabolism and climate change"* from the laboratory of *"Cities, Urbanism and Sustainable Development"*. His research focuses on assessing the climate impacts and incorporating the climate component in the economic development process and simutaling sustainable urban transformations. He intends to orchestrate several research projects (sea-level rise & machine learning, WFE nexus & system dynamics, planetary boundaries & gamification, smart cities & idling capacity), both within and outside academia.

## Current focus 

Currently, I'm interested in designing a rapid whole system change on a global scale using new relevant sustainability metrics in a data-driven approach coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. I aim to clearly identify social tipping points using behavioral mechanisms and pattern recognition to find structure in chaotic social/economic/urban environments.

## Detailed introduction 

My name is Mohamed Hachaichi, I have a PhD. in circular urban metabolism and climate change from the laboratory of “Cities, Urbanism and Sustainable development” at the Polytechnic School of Architecture and Urbanism (Algiers, Algeria). I am a researcher with a solid background in linear algebra, statistics, science, and programming. I’m enthusiastic about artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and passionate about science journalism.


I am fascinated by the research of a multidisciplinary nature. During my professional career, I’ve worked at the Polytechnic School of Architecture and Urbanism (Algiers, Algeria) as a university teacher, at the University of Stellenbosch (Cape Town, South Africa) as center manager and researcher, at EM Normandy Business School (Caen, France) as an assistant researcher, and currently at Institute of Urbanism and Geography Alpes (Grenoble, France) as a postdoc fellow.  


I defended my Ph.D. thesis entitled *“Carbon Carrying Capacity (C3) as a monitoring-controlling tool for Algiers urban model towards environmental sustainability and climate resiliency”* in 2021 with a degree of __*"So honorable"*__. I have published several scientific papers that can testify to my climate expertise and computational skills. For instance, I m the author of the first attempt to [downscale the planetary boundaries framework to the city-scale level](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338721106_Downscaling_the_planetary_boundaries_Pbs_framework_to_city_scale-level_De-risking_MENA_region's_environment_future). I’ve also published the first paper (study/research) on estimating [virtual carbon emissions in the big cities of middle-income countries](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354968873_Virtual_carbon_emissions_in_the_big_cities_of_middle-income_countries) using Extended-Environmental Input-Output Analysis (EE IOA). I’ve also published an article on how the [carbon footprint can be a plea for Algiers toward energy transition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342503813_The_Carbon_Footprint_Model_as_a_plea_for_Cities_towards_Energy-Transition_The_case_of_Algiers-Algeria). I’ve published [the most comprehensive database on the virtual carbon footprint of cities, worldwide (with 24,110 cities) using machine learning algorithms](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364769527_Cities_Allocating_climate_change_responsibilities_at_planetary_scale). I’ve also published a work with my colleagues from the University of Stellenbosch on the impacts of climate change on the Water-Food-Energy (WFE) nexus in cities using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning under the title [Water-Food-Energy Nexus in global cities: Addressing complex urban interdependencies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11269-023-03455-7).


I believe that I have all the skills required for the position (statistics, cartography, scientific writing, technical skills in quantitative and qualitative methods, and especially deep interest in the climate change topic as it is my main window of expertise). 

Remaining at your disposal for any further information.

I thank you for your consideration.
