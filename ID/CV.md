_I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Urbanism and Geography Alpes (IUGA) at Grenoble Aples University. I hold a Ph.D. in circular urban metabolism and climate change delivered by the laboratory of "Cities, Urbanism and Sustainable development" at the Polytechnic school of Architecture and Urbanism (Algiers-Algeria)._

_Currently interested in designing a rapid whole system change on a global scale using new relevant sustainability metrics in a data-driven approach coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. I Aim to clearly identify social tipping points using behavioral mechanisms and pattern recognition to find structure in chaotic social/economic/urban environments._

- Territorial systems' resilience: 
   - Ecological metabolism is composed of two entries: (i) Input section includes water, raw materials inputs, and energy. (ii) Output includes carbon emissions (CO2), waste water, and solid wastes. 
  - Affluence flux. 
  - Governance structure.

**Assistant Researcher, [EM Normandie Business School]('https://www.em-normandie.com/en/caen-campus')** (11/2021 - 07/2022, Caen, France)

- Collecting, cleaning & harmonizing COVID-19-related data:  
  - Explaining the spatial diffusion of the COVID-19 across EU regions (spatial econometrics models). 
  - Explain why some regions were severely hit by the virus and others were not.

**Center Manager, [Stellenbosch University]("https://arua.org.za/centres-of-excellence/coe-energy/#:~:text=The%20ARUA%20CoE%20in%20Energy,sustainable%20agricultural%20development%20in%20Africa.")** (2011 - 2012, Cape Twon, South Africa)

- CoT's WFE nexus model: a six-way perspective (compromising population, agriculture, water, energy, economy, and climate).
The model uses a system dynamics framework. To predict water availability at the catchment areas, precipitation was predicted using 17 climate parameters through 3 climate scenarios using a downscaling process of Global Climate Models (GCM), and then after we used the downscaled data into a PCNN model using a Transfer-Learning approach. 
- Climate change - water scarcity - droughts
