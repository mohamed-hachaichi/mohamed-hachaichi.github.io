Experience
---------
**Assistant Researcher, [EM Normandie]('https://www.em-normandie.com/en/caen-campus')** (11/2021-07/2022, Caen, France)

- Collecting, cleaning & harmonizing COVID-19-related data:  
Explaining the spatial diffusion of the COVID-19 across EU regions (spatial econometrics models)
Explain why some regions were severely hit by the virus and others were not.

**Center Manager, [Stellenbosch University]("https://arua.org.za/centres-of-excellence/coe-energy/#:~:text=The%20ARUA%20CoE%20in%20Energy,sustainable%20agricultural%20development%20in%20Africa.")** (2011-2012, Cape Twon, South Africa)

- CoT's WFE nexus model: a six-way perspective (compromising population, agriculture, water, energy, economy, and climate).
The model uses a system dynamics framework. To predict water availability at the catchment areas, precipitation was predicted using 17 climate parameters through 3 climate scenarios using a downscaling process of Global Climate Models (GCM), and then after we used the downscaled data into a PCNN model using a Transfer-Learning approach. 
Climate change - water scarcity - droughts
