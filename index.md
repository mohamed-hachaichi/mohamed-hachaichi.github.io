Thank you for visiting my personal website. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Urbanism and Geography Alpes (IUGA) at Grenoble Aples University. I am also a nomad researcher affilaited to an international network of researchers working on "rapide whole system change". I hold a Ph.D. in *circular urban metabolism and climate change* from the Polytechnic school of Architecutre and Urbanism (Algiers-Algeria). 

My research interest is in applied urban and regional economics, with an emphasis on the role of social interactions in determining economic outcomes of people and places. My current work considers how climate policy networks and peer-cities differ between regions with different backgrounds. In other work, I also looked at the diffusion over social networks of plausibly exogenous local economic shocks across geographically distant labour markets, and at the role of social connectedness in the transfer of knowledge.

Outside of academia, I consulted in various capacities for the public sector, conducting studies and evaluations, notably in the area of EU regional policy. I am experienced in the quantitative analysis of local economies, including the application of spatial econometric techniques, geographic information systems, and the study of networks.
