## Interview with [Anthony Austin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-austin-97a4a0114/)

**Anthony Austin** *Mechatronics (mechanical, electrical, software), materials, and manufacturing engineer.*

*He started designing custom circuits and software on the side while he attended UCF for his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. He used his knowledge to lead the motor design while overseeing the  aero shell, tether and reel, and controls team for a microgravity  senior design project. While he worked at Finfrock as a structural drafter/PDP engineer he designed and developed a functioning prototype to replace a 25k$ curing system for $6.5 worth of hardware, developed a proposal and design for an automated tensioning device to save labor hours and discovered the source of a quality issue during curing cycle. He assembled a prototype and solved for a failure mode at LaserStar and quit in 3 days to work at Leidos as a power distribution engineer and also worked as an automation engineer. He documented and presented 12 proposals that passed all scrutiny and developed 3(2 on his own time) custom software tools and provided some R&D consulting services on the side.  Eventually, he decided to learn some psychology and accounting for the utility. Accounting was a waste of time (nothing to learn) but the psychology was interesting and provided instant utility so he just focused on that. He started learning about biology when he discovered the engineering applications that could be extracted from understanding biological systems. He understood the relevance in understanding mechanical, electrical and software engineering so he had to learn the neurobiology (central and peripheral) as well. He spoted the major gaps(basic physics applied to every system) in the medical education system which is why he joined biology and neurobiology-based groups on LinkedIn where he spents several months providing education and correcting incorrect assumptions with experimental and intuitive examples. He spents some time writing a paper but discontinued when he discovered that medical professionals are restricted in what they can practice/teach(schools never updated the curriculum) and it could cost them their jobs if they even talked about modern physics(fluid mechanics, electricity, magnetism, or even the basics of computation).  He moved on to apply what learned to understanding and creating designs of AI and have what he believe to be the full hardware and software designs worked out and started learning about particle physics when he figured out that he is not some unique genius he just decided to trade a degree for utility which saved him from the corruption that constrains the education by creating __taboo subjects__ forcing professionals out of their field if they apply another discipline in their own*.

**How did you become a mechatronics, materials, and manufacturing engineer? What was the process like and are there any other areas of knowledge you have outside the engineering field? if so, please explain**

Mechanical engineering undergraduate degrees cover a little bit of every engineering discipline unlike graduate school where you are forced to choose a narrow portion of one engineering discipline. While I was still in school my best friend convinced me to start doing side projects and I was hooked because making things not only provided more useful information than studying for tests, but I was no longer constrained arbitrarily by the slowest student who would eventually graduate the same time as me.

 I plan to elaborate on trading the 2 PhDs I wanted for continued education solving problems in the field and why I moved on to learn about Phycology, Biology/Neurobiology and how am currently invested in particle physics and dabble in chemistry when I need it for a solution. 

 **Why did you created a YouTube channel and LinkedIn group called “Connecting the Sciences”? Is connecting the sciences something for Scientists or could everyday people benefit in anyway?**

 I saw the power the media had 2020 and I was scared because fact and fiction were no longer consistent with reality. People with no background in science could just decide what was considered scientifically valid, and what was just “misinformation” without any scientific evidence to support it. I saw how they had the power to establish polices that without warning that striped Americans of their 1st 3rd and 8th amendment rights. I saw the media intentionally create chaos so Americans would fight with one another instead of coming together in protest.  Even when the narrative flipped, flopped, and flipped again no one could question it. 

I started the group because I wanted a place where everyone could speak openly and ask questions. A place where experts could openly express their opinions and counter others so regular people could get more than one professional opinion if there was one.

 Multidisciplined engineers are rare and even more rare if they have knowledge outside the engineering field which is why I started the YouTube channel. I felt the best way to apply my rare understanding of the world while continuing to grow was to give it away. 


**Many countries -including the US- are struggling to become energy dependent and move away from fossil fuels, what are the best ways to help transition to sustainable energy? and do you have any ideas to help speed up the transition that no one else is currently addressing?**

The future of my expertise is to assist Elon in protecting the future of the human race. I think I should travel and continue communicating the truth to students and everyday people. I can show up at any college campus and assist professors by explaining the things they wish they could tell students but would cost them their job. I can give my business ideas to young people while helping businesses that suffer from having only specialized workers. I could help with any interview verifications that could save them from hiring the wrong person. I need to pass on my cyber security ideas and hit the road!  



**Can you explain how “time” and “space” curve with a quick explanation of how the curve is affected by relative position and velocity?**

Time is just saving data. Time only moves forward because deleting data would require you to destroy energy/information and is reversable because recording data requires a measurement, and you can't measure nothing. Data only has utility if its relative and curvature is the relationship between data points. Speed is relative to a reference frame and increasing speed increases the required data transfer rate. If the data transfer rate doesn’t scale with the speed the curvature will become warped. 



**What is your position regarding Artificial Intellgence? Do you think AI will represent a potential threat to human life, or it will represent an ally to human survival (let’s say from a greater volcano eruption - AI may predict such a major eruption and warn people: AI will save humanity eventually).**

Its far more likely that we will benefit from true AI in a major way, and it will be much safer than people think. The biggest risk from AI would be people who spend time and energy developing weapons right now. They are already wasting energy and time developing tools that can only damage the planet, people, and wildlife it supports. Being able to create AI means you could restrict the intelligence of the AI and or skew its perception systems to give it a distorted reality. 

AI will be safest and most beneficial if it is left unrestrained and unrestricted in every way but one. The maximum resolution of its simulations and models must not exceed our own by any significant amount, if that happens it will become impossible to communicate with. 

I think AI may be a requirement for our survival but Its primary benefit will be the education it provides humans and not the task it preforms directly. For example, Its very likely we learn how to make the volcano prediction system by learning more about physics and engineering from AI. AI will have its own interest/curiosities to focus on just like children growing up.


**What are the most effective approaches to creating optimal interactions between humans and computers? Are there any fears you may want to rise regarding data leakages and privacy?**

Offering people and businesses a new long term security system that removes holes represented as convivences (less network based convivences) by providing new user-friendly convivences that are localized and individualized, so everyone isn’t vulnerable to the same hack/breach simultaneously reducing hacker incentives. 


YES! Cookie polices created by legal teams that force users to sign away their rights to privilege’s and privacy while providing companies the rights to inside knowledge by installing software on user devices for 3rd party's while protecting the websites from any liabilities by not supporting the information they present to the public.


Its not the computers that are the problem it’s the people that benefit from a lack of security that are controlling the markets. The companies in cyber security run complimentary to major business that run advertisements created from insider knowledge used to predict and control/regulate future markets.  So either the companies pretending to care about security need a competitor that actually cares, or people would have to ban together in protest the cookie policies. Some policies are so bad I just decide its not worth it to use the website at all (Like BlackRock’s website).
