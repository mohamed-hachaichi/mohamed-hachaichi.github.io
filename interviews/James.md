## Interview with [James Gien Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-gien-wong-497471164/)

*__Bio:__*

James (Gien) Wong is co-founder of Stop Reset Go, a global citizen's collective focusing on sense-making and developing scaleable, bottom-up, rapid whole system change. He is also an action researcher in the commons focusing on commons leverage points including inner transformation, outer transformation and the tight coupling between the two. He has a background in electronic communications, circuit board design and industrial, control systems technology but migrated to nonlinear, social-ecological system intervention design, with a special focus on leverage points, idling resources and  social tipping points with the dawning of the crisis humanity faces in the Anthropocene.

*__What do you see as the most promising ways to resolve the many challenges the world faces today?__*

There is an enormous range of issues that need to be addressed simultaneously and quickly. What makes it difficult is that we have a shortening action time window and due to many reasons, vast fragmentation and insufficient levels of cooperation. My focus is on 1) collective, inclusive whole-system sensemaking to emerge the necessary wisdom, strategies and leverage points and use that to pilot 2) harmonized, commons-based, humanity-scale rapid whole system change systems.

*__You are talking about transformation on a civilizational scale and it’s already happening but not fast enough. What ideas emerged out of your sensemaking to accelerate the processes already taking place?__*

Since we are dealing with a complex system, we need to take an inclusive, multi-dimensional, multi-scale approach. Our current civilization is like a sinking ship with many holes, each one growing larger and new ones appearing at an ever increasing rate. We need system-wide collaboration at every scale and dimension in order to plug these leaks with great efficacy and prevent our civilization from sinking. Hence, in our sensemaking, what has emerged is a multi-dimensional, multi-scale solution, from inner, psychological dimension to outer social dimension, from individual scale, all the way to entire civilization scale. In terms of speed of change, identifying leverage points, social tipping points and idling resources are critical.

*__Why do you think downscaling the planetary boundaries (PBs) is vital to achieving local, regional, and hence global sustainability?__*

To properly answer this question requires a little background first. Modern humans are characterized by having a dual nature. You can think of this as two overlapping worlds that we simultaneously co-inhabit, the symbolosphere and the physiosphere (Schumann et al). The symbolosphere is the world of our symbols and the physiosphere the phenomenological world of our senses. Very simplistically, complex issues like climate change are far more meaningful to those who have spent much of their lives in the symbolosphere, working and gaining familiarity with the nuances of symbols, complex scientific instrumentation, complex mathematical formulas and algorithms, science, academia, policy, etc. Of course almost all modern humans, including those without formal education are introduced to the symbolosphere through their upbringing in their culture, where they are introduced to their mother tongue. But billions of people use language in a colloquial way, not a formal, institutional way. It’s been shown over and over again that the knowledge deficit model doesn’t work in changing people’s priorities of climate change. People are loyal to their tribes, and the belief systems of their tribes. In addition, climate change and the sophisticated symbolic constructs that validate it do not trigger the fight or flight response in our default sensory based system that humans have evolved to adapt to. In order to appreciate these sophisticated ideas people must undergo deep institutional enculturation and we don’t have time for that. Subsequently, hyperobject ideas such as “the planet is burning” are foreign and meaningless in the framework of billions of people. For half the planet, daily survival is a far more important issue. Economics is therefore more pressing than Ecology.

With this background, we are now equipped to answer the question. As the name suggests, planetary boundaries relate to the entire planet and while these are critical to provide a global indicator of the current level of earth system parameters, they are normally quite abstract hyperobjects that are beyond the relevance of billions of ordinary people. Recent perturbations in the climate system however, are causing noticeable and disruptive instabilities such as more intense and more frequent extreme weather events, which in turn helps turn an abstract concept into a concrete, experienceable and meaningful one. There is now an opportunity to harness the growing awareness of the immediate threat of climate change to engage ordinary people in system change. One way to mobilize and awaken collective agency is by localizing or downscaling planetary boundaries, associating them with local socio-economic indicators and extreme weather disruption. This is because downscaling them and synchronizing to local socio-economic indicators (ie. achieving local, measurable doughnut economics)  translates improvements in local ecological conditions to mitigation of locally experienced extreme weather events and improvement of local economic conditions. Gamifying the downscaled P.B. and doughnut economics of every community on the planet can mobilize the global solidarity needed now for rapid system change. This approach allows the billions of disempowered citizens of the world to drive the rapid change necessary directly and from the bottom, rather than the traditional disempowered default approach of  lobbying slow-moving, top-down, incumbent actors, many of whom have too much vested interest tied to the old carbon intensive system. A groundswell bottom-up surge can make the difference to unblock the policy obstacles faced by top down actors.

*__How is your startup contributing in tackling climate change? What has been done? And what is on the agenda?__*

Stop Reset Go has performed years of collective, trans-disciplinary sensemaking and from this has developed a provisional multiprong, multi-dimensional, multi-scale, rapid whole system change strategy. I’m hesitant to call it a solution as there are still unknowns and wicked problems don’t have solutions.  It needs to be gradually tested and scaled and shown to work and not bring about unintended consequences (progress traps) but by looking at distant connections between radically different disciplines and seeing important relationships normally not explored, we can better understand why certain obstacles seem intractable and why moving beyond them requires novel strategies.Understanding both the long term, anthropological reasons as well as middle and short term factors leading to the polycrisis in modernity helps us to mold the optimal strategy.
